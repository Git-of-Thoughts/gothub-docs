## What is Gothub.AI?

Our platform has three key ingredients that make this magic happen: the Agent, the Oracles, and the Abilities. Let's break it down.

## What is an Oracle?

An **Oracle** is a "recipe" that helps guide the **Agent** to cook up a software. It shows you the final goal you're trying to reach.

## What is an Ability?

An **Ability** is a "kitchen tool" that helps the **Agent** to cook up a software. It serves as the utensils you need for cooking.

## What is an Agent?

An **Agent** is a "master chef" that can cook up a software. Picture it as your personal chef. It uses the tools you've provided, follows the recipes, and carries out your command, right up to the point your project is ready to serve.
