# Introduction

Without any first-line magic, the default language model will be used.

**Cell**

```python
What is the meaning of life?
```

**Output**

```markdown
ChatGPT gpt-4:

The meaning of life is a philosophical and metaphysical question...
```

By default, the chat history will be kept, same as ChatGPT.

**Cell**

```python
What did I just ask?
```

**Output**

```markdown
ChatGPT gpt-4:

You just asked about the meaning of life.
```

## First-line magics

### Start a new chat

This will clear chat history but not system message.

**Cell**

```python
as new chat

What did I just ask?
```

**Output**

```markdown
ChatGPT gpt-4:

As an AI, I can't answer this question without a previous context.
```

### Execute Python code

**Cell**

```python
as code

print("Hello GotHub!")
```

**Output**

```
Hello GotHub!
```

### Talk to GPT-3.5 in current cell

```python
with gpt-3.5

What is the meaning of life?
```

or

```python
with gpt3.5

What is the meaning of life?
```

### Talk to GPT-4 in current cell

```python
with gpt-4

What is the meaning of life?
```

or

```python

### Talk to other models

ðŸ‘ˆ Check out the [ðŸ¤– Models](Models.mdx) page for all available models.

### Get account information

```python
print account
```

## As code: `got` library

`got` has some convenient functions to interact with the models, the code environment,
and the storage system.

Fun fact: `got` stands for "git of thoughts".

### Talk to the default language model

```python
as code

from got import ask
response = ask("What is the meaning of life?")
```

### Talk to GPT-3.5 in current cell using code

```python

as code

from got import ask
response = ask("What is the meaning of life?")
```
