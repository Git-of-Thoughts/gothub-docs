# Introduction

## First-line magic

Without any first-line magic, the default large language model will be used.

```python
What is the meaning of life?
```

> **ChatGPT gpt-4:**
> The meaning of life is a philosophical and metaphysical question related to the significance of living or existence in general. Many interpretations often relate to one's purpose, fulfillment, or the pursuit of happiness. However, it can vary greatly among different cultures, religions, philosophical views. It's a deeply personal and subjective topic.

By default, the chat history will be kept, same as ChatGPT.

```python
What did I just ask?
```

> **ChatGPT gpt-4:**
> You just asked about the meaning of life.

### To start a new chat

This will clear chat history but not system message.

```python
as new chat
What did I just ask?
```

> **ChatGPT gpt-4:**
> As an AI, I can't answer this question without a previous context. Please tell me what you asked me.

### To execute Python code

```python
as code
print("Hello world!")
```

### To talk to GPT-3.5 in current cell
