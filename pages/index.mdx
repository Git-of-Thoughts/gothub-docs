# Introduction

## First-line magics

Without any first-line magic, the default large language model will be used.

**Cell**

```python
What is the meaning of life?
```

**Output**

```markdown
ChatGPT gpt-4:

The meaning of life is a philosophical and metaphysical question...
```

By default, the chat history will be kept, same as ChatGPT.

**Cell**

```python
What did I just ask?
```

**Output**

```markdown
ChatGPT gpt-4:

You just asked about the meaning of life.
```

### To start a new chat

This will clear chat history but not system message.

**Cell**

```python
as new chat
What did I just ask?
```

**Output**

```markdown
ChatGPT gpt-4:

As an AI, I can't answer this question without a previous context.
```

### To execute Python code

**Cell**

```python
as code
print("Hello GotHub!")
```

**Output**

```markdown
Hello GotHub!
```

### To talk to GPT-3.5 in current cell

```python
with gpt-3.5
What is the meaning of life?
```

or

```python
with gpt3.5
What is the meaning of life?
```

### To talk to GPT-4 in current cell

```python
with gpt-4
What is the meaning of life?
```

or

```python
with gpt4
What is the meaning of life?
```

## As code: `got` library

`got` has some convient functions to interact with the models, the code environment,
and the storage system.

Fun fact: `got` stands for "git of thoughts".

### To talk to the default large langauge model

```python
as code
from got import ask
response = ask("What is the meaning of life?")
```

### To talk to GPT-3.5 in current cell using code

```python
with gpt-3.5 as code
from got import ask
response = ask("What is the meaning of life?")
```

### To talk to GPT-4 in current cell using code

```python
with gpt-4 as code
from got import ask
response = ask("What is the meaning of life?")
```
